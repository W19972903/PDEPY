This repository contains Python code for the examples in the paper "Automatic pre- and post-conditions for partial differential equations"
by Michele Boreale (October 2019); pdf of the paper also in the repository. 

Summary.
Given a set of PDE systems ("stratified system"), the POST algorithm computes (weakest) 
preconditions and (strongest) postconditions as specified below (subject to certain restrictions; 
see paper).

Usage: see code.

Code tested under the Anaconda distribution for Windows 10.
