This repository contains the Python code for the examples in the paper "Automatic pre- and post-conditions for partial differential equations",
by Michele Boreale (April 2020). The PDF of the paper is also in this repository. 

Summary.
Given a set of PDE systems ("stratified system"), the POST algorithm computes (weakest) 
preconditions and (strongest) postconditions as specified in the code (subject to certain restrictions; 
see paper).

Usage: see code.

Code tested under the Anaconda distribution for Windows 10.
